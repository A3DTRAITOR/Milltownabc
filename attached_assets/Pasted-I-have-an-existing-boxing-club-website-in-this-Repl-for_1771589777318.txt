I have an existing boxing club website in this Repl for UK users only.
I am happy with all current pages, layout, styling, and wording and I do not want these changed.

Your task is to make all existing signup / registration / contact forms behave like a typical modern UK website in terms of input validation and error handling.

General constraints

Do not redesign anything.

Do not add, remove, or rename any form fields.

Do not change any visible text, labels, headings, or content.

Only change code where needed to add or improve validation and error handling.

For every form on the site (especially member signup):

Use appropriate HTML5 types and required flags

Use type="email" for emails, type="tel" for phone numbers, type="password" for passwords, type="date" for dates, type="number" where numeric input is expected.

Add the required attribute to all fields that must be filled in for a normal signup in the UK (e.g. name, email, mobile number, date of birth, any mandatory consents).

Add reasonable minlength / maxlength to prevent extremely short or excessively long inputs.

UK mobile phone numbers

Assume users are in the UK.

Use type="tel".

Accept common UK mobile formats, for example:

07123 456789

07123456789

+44 7123 456789

+447123456789

Before validating, strip spaces, dashes, and brackets.

Validate that the cleaned number is either:

A UK mobile starting 07 with 11 digits total, or

Starts with +44 followed by 10 digits (and represents a mobile, starting 7 after the country code).

Reject inputs containing letters or obviously wrong lengths, and show a clear, friendly error message telling the user to enter a UK mobile number in a typical format.

UK address and postcode (if present)

Treat address fields as UK addresses.

For postcode fields, trim spaces and convert to uppercase before validation/storage.

Apply a sensible UK postcode pattern that allows common formats (e.g. SW1A 1AA, M1 1AE, W1A 0AX, EC1A 1BB), but don’t be so strict that valid edge cases are rejected.

Show a helpful message if the postcode is clearly not a valid UK format.

Date of birth and age

Use type="date" where possible.

On submit, calculate age based on today’s date and ensure the member is within a sensible UK age range for a boxing gym (for example, minimum 12 years old – you choose the exact rule and implement it consistently).

Show a clear error if they are too young or outside the allowed range.

Email addresses

Use type="email" and rely on standard HTML5 validation plus any light additional checks if needed.

Accept normal UK‑style everyday emails (Gmail, Outlook, iCloud, etc.) without being overly strict.

Trim whitespace and normalise case where appropriate before validating.

Passwords (if registration/login exists)

Enforce a minimum length (at least 8–10 characters).

Include a confirm‑password field that must match exactly.

Do not display the actual password in any error messages or logs.

Error messages and UX

On the client side, prevent form submission if required fields are empty or invalid.

Highlight invalid fields and place clear, friendly error messages next to them, using language appropriate for UK users (e.g. “Please enter a valid UK mobile number”).

Move focus to the first invalid field after a failed submit.

Server‑side validation (backend):

Mirror the same rules on the server for all forms (UK mobiles, UK postcodes, age limits, required fields, etc.).

Never rely only on client‑side checks.

Trim whitespace, normalise formats (e.g. strip spaces from phone numbers, uppercase postcodes), and safely handle special characters to avoid security issues.

Reject obviously invalid or malicious input and return the same kind of friendly error messages where appropriate.

Finally:

Only touch the minimum code required to implement or improve validation and error handling for UK users.

Do not alter layout, design, or content.

When you are finished, list which forms you improved and briefly summarise the validation rules now applied (especially for UK mobile numbers, postcodes, and age).
