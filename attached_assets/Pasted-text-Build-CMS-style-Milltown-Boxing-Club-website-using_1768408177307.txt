Build CMS-style Milltown Boxing Club website using my existing template structure, ADDING full user accounts + advanced booking system with Stripe payments. Keep all current CMS database structure, just enhance with these features:

**PRESERVE EXISTING CMS TEMPLATE** (don't rebuild from scratch):
- Keep current database schema, pages, styling, admin panel
- Add to existing user table or create members table
- Use same color scheme: #000000, #FFFFFF, #F5F5F5, #C8102E, #4A5568
- Logo: 1000014202.jpg → /public/logo.png

**NEW USER SYSTEM** (build on existing CMS):
1. **/register** - Create account (name, email, phone, password, experience level)
2. **/login** - Member login with password reset  
3. **/dashboard** - Personal area showing "My Bookings", profile, payment history
4. **/sessions** - Live schedule (available/booked) with "Book Now" buttons
5. **/book/:id** - Specific session booking → Stripe Checkout → confirmation

**DATABASE STRUCTURE** (add to existing tables):
members: id, name, email, phone, password_hash, experience_level, created_at
sessions: id, title, date, time, capacity, booked_count, class_type, price
bookings: id, member_id, session_id, stripe_payment_id, status, booked_at

**CORE FLOW**:
1. New user → Register/Login → See live session schedule
2. Click available session → Stripe Checkout (£15) → Booking confirmed  
3. Dashboard shows all their bookings + "Cancel" (with refund link)
4. Admin sees all bookings, members, sessions (existing admin enhanced)

**PAGES TO ADD** (match existing template design):
- /login, /register, /dashboard, /sessions, /profile
- Keep homepage with "Login to Book" prominent CTA

**RESPONSIVE DESIGN** (CRITICAL):
- Fully responsive across ALL devices (desktop, tablet, mobile)
- Mobile-first: Perfect on iPhone/Android (large touch buttons, readable fonts)
- NO overlap: Elements stack cleanly, nothing blocks other content
- Clear spacing: 20px+ gaps between sections/buttons
- Concise layout: No clutter, every element has breathing room
- Fast scrolling: No fixed/sticky overlaps, smooth mobile experience

**STRIPE INTEGRATION**:
- Hosted Checkout after session selection
- Prompt for test/live keys 
- UK cards + Apple/Google Pay
- Webhook confirms booking on payment success

**SECURITY & PRODUCTION READY**:
- Password hashing (bcrypt)
- Session authentication  
- CSRF protection on all forms
- Input sanitization
- Rate limiting on bookings
- HTTPS redirect
- Error pages (404, 500) matching design
- SEO meta tags + OpenGraph
- Loading states + success animations

**EMAILS**:
- Booking confirmation (member + admin)
- Session reminders (24hrs before)
- Account registration welcome

**LAUNCH READY**:
- Create 5 sample sessions for demo (this week + next)
- Generate README: Stripe setup, admin login (milltown2025), IONOS deploy steps
- Backup database export for admin
