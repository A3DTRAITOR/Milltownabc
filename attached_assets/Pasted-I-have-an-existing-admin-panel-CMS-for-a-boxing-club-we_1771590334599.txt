I have an existing admin panel / CMS for a boxing club website.
I am happy with the current functionality and fields, but I want to polish and simplify the admin UI, especially for mobile use.
Requirements and constraints:


The gym owner will mostly edit content on their phone, so design the admin as mobile‑first and then enhance it for desktop.


Do not remove or rename any existing fields, routes, or core functionality.


Do not change any labels or wording used in the admin.


Public‑facing pages must remain visually the same; only adjust the admin UI.


Mobile‑first layout:


On small screens, remove the fixed sidebar and replace it with a simple top bar: a title on the left and a hamburger menu on the right that opens the existing navigation as an overlay/drawer.


Use a single‑column layout for the content editor: labels above inputs, fields stacked vertically, full‑width with padding, and generous vertical spacing.


Make inputs and buttons large and easy to tap (approximately 44–48px tall) with clear separation between groups of fields.


Replace cramped horizontal tabs for pages/sections with a mobile‑friendly control, such as:


A dropdown at the top saying “Editing: [Home ▼]”, or


A simple list of pages on a first screen that navigates to a single‑page edit screen.




Reducing visual overload:


Keep the default edit view short and focused on the essential fields (e.g. hero title, hero subtitle, main content).


Move non‑essential or advanced fields (such as SEO title/description, advanced settings) into collapsible sections or an “Advanced / SEO” panel that can be expanded when needed.


Use light borders and plenty of whitespace; avoid nested heavy cards and unnecessary lines so the interface feels clean and calm.


Actions and feedback:


On mobile, make the primary action “Save Changes” a clear, prominent button near the bottom of the form, ideally full‑width and easy to reach with a thumb.


Ensure the save button and any secondary actions have enough spacing so they’re not easy to tap by mistake.


Keep validation and error messages simple and inline next to the relevant fields, without cluttering the screen.


Desktop enhancement (responsive only):


For larger screens, you may reintroduce the sidebar and centered content card, but only via responsive CSS / layout changes, keeping the mobile structure as the base.


On desktop, preserve the clean single‑column form and clear spacing; do not cram extra controls into the view.


Implementation details:


Refactor the admin templates/components and styles to follow this mobile‑first approach.


Use responsive breakpoints so that the mobile layout is the default and the desktop enhancements are additive.


After making the changes, briefly describe what you changed in the admin UI and confirm that no public‑facing pages were altered.
